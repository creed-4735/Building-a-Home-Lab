# Building a Home Lab.

## Objective


My goal is to build a personal cybersecurity homelab that simulates real-world environments to practice security hardening, network defense, and incident response. This lab will give me the opportunity to strengthen my hands-on skills with industry tools and technologies while expanding my technical knowledge. By documenting my progress and projects, I can showcase my problem-solving abilities and technical expertise to potential employers.
