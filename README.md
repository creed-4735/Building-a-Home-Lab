# Building a Home Lab.

## Objective


My goal is to build a personal cybersecurity homelab that simulates real-world environments to practice security hardening, network defense, and incident response. This lab will give me the opportunity to strengthen my hands-on skills with industry tools and technologies while expanding my technical knowledge. By documenting my progress and projects, I can showcase my problem-solving abilities and technical expertise to potential employers.

### Skills Learned

- Virtaulization 
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used


- VirtualBox
- Windows 11 iso image
- Kali Linux


## Steps

- 1. Install VirtualBox:

  Install Virtual Box along with all necessary dependencies to include python core and win-32-api for full functionality.

- 4. Install Splunk

  Splunk will act as the secuirty informantion and event management (SIEM) tool. This tool will allow me to simulate an enterpirse environment by managing log files for analysis, detect possible secuirty threats, track performance metrics, and generate dashboards/reports for data insights.
